# BB01 Tribble Badge

## Overview
This is copy of the original repo hosted privately elsewhere. It's been posted
here for historical use.

All the schematics, source code, and website code are located here in their
respective directories.

To build, you will need the Arduino IDE and the Adafruit library. For more
information, see https://tribb01.party/badge (also in `web/src/badge/`).

Schematics were made using Fritzing. I went straight from the breadboard
view to the PCB view (which then borked the breadboard view!) for this
simple PCB so the schematic view is a bit of a mess.

## LEDs
The two NeoPixel Jewels are roughly arranged in a 6x5 grid.
