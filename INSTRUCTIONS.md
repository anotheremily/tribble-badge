# triBB01 Badge Notes
You have one of the first Beyond Binaries badges!

We call it triBB01.

## Styles
As you may have noticed, BB01 comes in a few styles. Pick the one you like most and enjoy! There's no wrong answer.

## Buttons
- Button 1 - Cycle color patterns
- Button 2 - Cycle color transitions
- Button 1 & 2 - Enter config mode

In config mode:
- Button 1 - Toggle Brightness (LOW - MEDIUM - HIGH - MAX)*
- Button 2 - Enter 8 Digit PIN (Locks button functions for next 8 presses.)
- Button 1 & 2 - Leave config mode

_* Adjust brightness at your own risk. The max setting will literally sear your all of your eyeballs._

## Lights
The Queercon folks always have camos, and we have some similar patterns. You’ll have a few activated by default, and more can be unlocked if you’re crafty enough! In addition to this, there are a few different color transitions for you to enjoy!

## Challenge
68 74 74 70 73 3a 2f 2f 74 72 69 62 62 30 31 2e 70 61 72 74 79

## Extra!
_Don’t judge my soldering! Or PCB layout._

All the insides can be repurposed after the conference! In addition to the NeoPixel Jewels on the outside, on the inside you’ll find a Trinket Mini 5V and some other goodies. The Trinket and Jewels are purposefully not soldered onto the board to make it easy to remove and use on your other projects! Of course if you want to leave the badge as is too, that's fine. Or play around with the source and add your own features!

If you do want to hack on the hardware or software, these links might be handy.
