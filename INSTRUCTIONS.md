# BB01 Badge Instructions

## Welcome
You have one of the first Beyond Binaries badges! We call it BB01.

We had a few objectives in mind when making this badge.
- To have a badge of our own
- To give us something to have fun with
- To look great
- To be useful to some extent after DEFCON
- To work (most important!)

## Guide

### Styles
As you may have noticed, BB01 comes in a few styles. This isn’t just skin deep and actually affects the functionality of each badge. You can unlock more features by pairing your badge with badges of other types.

### Buttons
- Button 1 - Cycle patterns
- Button 2 -
- Button 3 -
- Button 4 -

### Modes
The Queercon folks always have camos, and we have some similar patterns. You’ll have a few activated by default, and more can be unlocked if you’re crafty enough!

### Pairing
While there’s no wireless on this year’s badge (hopefully next year!), there is a pairing mode. Pairing with different types of badges will unlock more features (pairing with badges of the same style will too depending on how many you’ve paired with.)

### Extra!
Tip: Don’t judge my soldering!

There’s one or more undocumented feature in this badge, plus a few things to explore. The first clue is at https://emily.cat/badge.

All the insides can be repurposed after the conference! In addition to the NeoPixel Jewels on the outside, on the inside you’ll find a Trinket Mini 5V and some other goodies. The Trinket is purposefully not soldered onto the board to make it easy to remove and use on your other projects!
