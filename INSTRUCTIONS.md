# triBB01 Badge Notes
You have one of the first Beyond Binaries badges!  It's a small run this year, so lucky you!

## Styles
As you may have noticed, BB01 comes in a few styles. Pick the one you like most and enjoy! There's no wrong answer.

## Buttons
- Button 1 - Cycle color patterns
- Button 2 - Cycle color transitions
- Button 1 & 2 - Toggle Brightness (LOW - MEDIUM - HIGH - MAX)*

_* Adjust brightness at your own risk. The max setting will literally sear your all of your eyeballs._

## Lights
The Queercon folks always have camos, and we have some similar patterns. In addition to this, there are a few different color transitions for you to enjoy!

## Challenge
I hear there are 4 "black badges" for the taking...

    68 74 74 70 73 3a 2f 2f 74 72 69 62 62 30 31 2e 70 61 72 74 79

## Extra! Please Hack on this Badge!
All the insides can be repurposed after the conference! In addition to the NeoPixel Jewels on the outside, on the inside youâ€™ll find a Trinket Mini 5V and some other goodies. The Trinket and Jewels are purposefully not soldered onto the board to make it easy to remove and use on your other projects! Of course if you want to leave the badge as is too, that's fine. Or play around with the source and add your own features! (two extra pins on the board are just begging for some love.)

If you want to hack on the hardware or software, these links might be handy.

## The End
Special thanks to Avi for help concepting and to Aaron for support and unknowingly feeding me ideas on the challenge badge.
