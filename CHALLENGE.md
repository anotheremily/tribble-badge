## Step 0 - Story
An unknown assailant has started assimilating triBB01s and making them into cyborg monsters (borBB01s). The remaining triBB01s need help locating and capturing the borBB01s before its too late!

## Step 1

## Step 2

## Step 3

## Step 4

## Step 5
Provide the GPS coordinates for the found triBB01. Only the first 4 decimal places matter.

The fourth decimal place is worth up to 11 m: it can identify a parcel of land. It is comparable to the typical accuracy of an uncorrected GPS unit with no interference.
The fifth decimal place is worth up to 1.1 m: it distinguish trees from each other. Accuracy to this level with commercial GPS units can only be achieved with differential correction.
